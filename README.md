# UR-repaired
A brand new design of the University of Richmond facilities interface

<hr>

-- This application allows users to post work requests in a much more modern fashion
in a public forum. Posts may be made private if needed.

-- Users can see ongoing work request and filter them by tag, geolocation, and text.
	Users can vote for ongoing requests and mark them as `Urgent', increasing their priority.

-- Users can post new work requests. They will be matched to existing request to avoid
	duplicates. Users can confirm that this work request isn't a duplicate and post it. 
	
-- Future:
	- Using learning algorithms, `automatically' determine the most important and
		pressing work request, automatically set older work request as expired if they aren't
		important.
	- Award students dining dollars for being good contributors to the facilities board.
